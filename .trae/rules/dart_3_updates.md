# Dart 3 Updates

### Branches
1. Use `if` statements for conditional branching. The condition must evaluate to a boolean.
2. `if` statements support optional `else` and `else if` clauses for multiple branches.
3. Use `if-case` statements to match and destructure a value against a single pattern. Example: `if (pair case [int x, int y]) { ... }`
4. If the pattern in an `if-case` matches, variables defined in the pattern are in scope for that branch.
5. If the pattern does not match in an `if-case`, control flows to the `else` branch if present.
6. Use `switch` statements to match a value against multiple patterns (cases). Each `case` can use any kind of pattern.
7. When a value matches a `case` pattern in a `switch` statement, the case body executes and control jumps to the end of the switch. `break` is not required.
8. You can end a non-empty `case` clause with `continue`, `throw`, or `return`.
9. Use `default` or `_` in a `switch` statement to handle unmatched values.
10. Empty `case` clauses fall through to the next case. Use `break` to prevent fallthrough.
11. Use `continue` with a label for non-sequential fallthrough between cases.
12. Use logical-or patterns (e.g., `case a || b`) to share a body or guard between cases.
13. Use `switch` expressions to produce a value based on matching cases. Syntax differs from statements: omit `case`, use `=>` for bodies, and separate cases with commas.
14. In `switch` expressions, the default case must use `_` (not `default`).
15. Dart checks for exhaustiveness in `switch` statements and expressions, reporting a compile-time error if not all possible values are handled.
16. To ensure exhaustiveness, use a default (`default` or `_`) case, or switch over enums or sealed types.
17. Use the `sealed` modifier on a class to enable exhaustiveness checking when switching over its subtypes.
18. Add a guard clause to a `case` using `when` to further constrain when a case matches. Example: `case pattern when condition:`
19. Guard clauses can be used in `if-case`, `switch` statements, and `switch` expressions. The guard is evaluated after pattern matching.
20. If a guard clause evaluates to false, execution proceeds to the next case (does not exit the switch).

### Patterns
1. Patterns are a syntactic category that represent the shape of values for matching and destructuring.
2. Pattern matching checks if a value has a certain shape, constant, equality, or type.
3. Pattern destructuring allows extracting parts of a matched value and binding them to variables.
4. Patterns can be nested, using subpatterns (outer/inner patterns) for recursive matching and destructuring.
5. Use wildcard patterns (`_`) to ignore parts of a matched value; use rest elements in list patterns to ignore remaining elements.
6. Patterns can be used in:
   - Local variable declarations and assignments
   - For and for-in loops
   - If-case and switch-case statements
   - Control flow in collection literals
7. Pattern variable declarations start with `var` or `final` and bind new variables from the matched value. Example: `var (a, [b, c]) = ('str', [1, 2]);`
8. Pattern variable assignments destructure a value and assign to existing variables. Example: `(b, a) = (a, b); // swap values`
9. Every case clause in `switch` and `if-case` contains a pattern. Any kind of pattern can be used in a case.
10. Case patterns are refutable; if the pattern doesn't match, execution continues to the next case.
11. Destructured values in a case become local variables scoped to the case body.
12. Use logical-or patterns (e.g., `case a || b`) to match multiple alternatives in a single case.
13. Use logical-or patterns with guards (`when`) to share a body or guard between cases.
14. Guard clauses (`when`) evaluate a condition after matching; if false, execution proceeds to the next case.
15. Patterns can be used in for and for-in loops to destructure collection elements (e.g., destructuring `MapEntry` in map iteration).
16. Object patterns match named object types and destructure their data using getters. Example: `var Foo(:one, :two) = myFoo;`
17. Use patterns to destructure records, including positional and named fields, directly into local variables.
18. Patterns enable algebraic data type style code: use sealed classes and switch on subtypes for exhaustive matching.
19. Patterns simplify validation and destructuring of complex data structures, such as JSON, in a declarative way. Example: `if (data case {'user': [String name, int age]}) { ... }`
20. Patterns provide a concise alternative to verbose type-checking and destructuring code.

### Pattern Types
1. Pattern precedence determines evaluation order; use parentheses to group lower-precedence patterns.
2. Logical-or patterns (`pattern1 || pattern2`) match if any branch matches, evaluated left-to-right. All branches must bind the same set of variables.
3. Logical-and patterns (`pattern1 && pattern2`) match if both subpatterns match. Bound variable names must not overlap between subpatterns.
4. Relational patterns (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) match if the value compares as specified to a constant. Useful for numeric ranges and can be combined with logical-and.
5. Cast patterns (`subpattern as Type`) assert and cast a value to a type before passing it to a subpattern. Throws if the value is not of the type.
6. Null-check patterns (`subpattern?`) match if the value is not null, then match the inner pattern. Binds the non-nullable type. Use constant pattern `null` to match null.
7. Null-assert patterns (`subpattern!`) match if the value is not null, else throw. Use in variable declarations to eliminate nulls. Use constant pattern `null` to match null.
8. Constant patterns match if the value is equal to a constant (number, string, bool, named constant, const constructor, const collection, etc.). Use parentheses and `const` for complex expressions.
9. Variable patterns (`var name`, `final Type name`) bind new variables to matched/destructured values. Typed variable patterns only match if the value has the declared type.
10. Identifier patterns (`foo`, `_`) act as variable or constant patterns depending on context. `_` always acts as a wildcard and matches/discards any value.
11. Parenthesized patterns (`(subpattern)`) control pattern precedence and grouping, similar to expressions.
12. List patterns (`[subpattern1, subpattern2]`) match lists and destructure elements by position. The pattern length must match the list unless a rest element is used.
13. Rest elements (`...`, `...rest`) in list patterns match arbitrary-length lists or collect unmatched elements into a new list.
14. Map patterns (`{"key": subpattern}`) match maps and destructure by key. Only specified keys are matched; missing keys throw a `StateError`.
15. Record patterns (`(subpattern1, subpattern2)`, `(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)`) match records by shape and destructure positional/named fields. Field names can be omitted if inferred from variable or identifier patterns.
16. Object patterns (`ClassName(field1: subpattern1, field2: subpattern2)`) match objects by type and destructure using getters. Extra fields in the object are ignored.
17. Wildcard patterns (`_`, `Type _`) match any value without binding. Useful for ignoring values or type-checking without binding.
18. All pattern types can be nested and combined for expressive and precise matching and destructuring.

### Records
1. Records are anonymous, immutable, aggregate types that bundle multiple objects into a single value.
2. Records are fixed-sized, heterogeneous, and strongly typed. Each field can have a different type.
3. Records are real values: store them in variables, nest them, pass to/from functions, and use in lists, maps, and sets.
4. Record expressions use parentheses with comma-delimited positional and/or named fields, e.g. `('first', a: 2, b: true, 'last')`.
5. Record type annotations use parentheses with comma-delimited types. Named fields use curly braces: `({int a, bool b})`.
6. The names of named fields are part of the record's type (shape). Records with different named field names have different types.
7. Positional field names in type annotations are for documentation only and do not affect the record's type.
8. Record fields are accessed via built-in getters: positional fields as `$1`, `$2`, etc., and named fields by their name (e.g., `.a`).
9. Records are immutable: fields do not have setters.
10. Records are structurally typed: the set, types, and names of fields define the record's type (shape).
11. Two records are equal if they have the same shape and all corresponding field values are equal. Named field order does not affect equality.
12. Records automatically define `hashCode` and `==` based on structure and field values.
13. Use records for functions that return multiple values; destructure with pattern matching: `var (name, age) = userInfo(json);`
14. Destructure named fields with the colon syntax: `final (:name, :age) = userInfo(json);`
15. Using records for multiple returns is more concise and type-safe than using classes, lists, or maps.
16. Use lists of records for simple data tuples with the same shape.
17. Use type aliases (`typedef`) for record types to improve readability and maintainability.
18. Changing a record type alias does not guarantee all code using it is still type-safe; only classes provide full abstraction/encapsulation.
19. Extension types can wrap records but do not provide full abstraction or protection.
20. Records are best for simple, immutable data aggregation; use classes for abstraction, encapsulation, and behavior.
